<details>
<summary><strong>Privacy: Using a test image instead of real camera footage</strong></summary>

If you don't want to show real camera footage in your screenshots, use the `--preview-source` flag:

```bash
camera --preview-source /path/to/image.png
# or with a video
camera --preview-source /path/to/video.mp4
```

This launches the app with your test file displayed instead of real camera footage. The window automatically sizes to 900x700, which is optimal for Flathub screenshots.

**Supported formats:** PNG, JPG, JPEG, WEBP (images) or MP4, WEBM, MKV (videos)

**Tip:** A colorful gradient image or the [Big Buck Bunny](https://peach.blender.org/) video works well for demonstrating filters and UI elements.
